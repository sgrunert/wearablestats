Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The data set in the wearablestats file is a combination and summarization of study data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0.[1][2] A study data package is provided as a zip file and was used as the raw data input for the wearablestats file.[3] Downstream processing to produce the wearablestats file is described below.


Original Study Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Excerpt from Study README file:[3]

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

Downstream Data Processing
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data processing combines the training and test raw datasets from the study, summarizes the mean and standard deviation columns by subject-actvity, and applies descriptive variable names. 

The sequence of data processing is as follows:

1) Initialize data directory.

2) Download zip file from the study website and unzip study raw data into the data directory.

3) Read in applicable study files and prepare subject-activity row identifiers.

4) Read in data files, label variable columns, reduce the number of columns, and merge into a single file.

5) Melt the combined data by subject-activity, aggregate variables as means, and otherwise reshape into a tidy dataset.

6) Write the tidy dataset to a flat file.

7) Clean-up post processing.
